Dissertation Writing WORKSHOP/SEMINAR for MTech Research Students  
Disesertation Writing Workshop/Seminar – The Department of Operations Managementes offers a 5-day series of writing workshops/seminars for MTech Research students – YOU ARE ENCOURAGED TO ATTEND.
Focusing on the interplay between writing and research, this 5-day Workshop/Seminar will help you to develop the skills that you will need to manage and write up your dissertation project. To get the most out of these sessions, be prepared to bring in samples of your own dissertation (Proposal) draft for workshop activities.
The aim of this Seminar is to expose students to the scientific method and quantitative approaches to research design and analysis of primary data. Students are given guidance in the writing of syndicate research proposals and research reports and given extensive feedback on their individual proposals.
Following the prescribed e-book, students groups move through the “research pipeline”, from conceptualizing their research problems, defining their research questions, drawing samples, collecting, analyzing and interpreting data, and presenting their findings.
The individual assignment tasks are based on students’ own individual proposals. Within days of completing this Seminar, the students should be ready to submit their formal individual proposals to the Department’s Research Committee.
Students will be encouraged to use either MS Excel, or SPSS software package, or both, for data analysis purposes.
